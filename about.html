			<h3>Bio</h3>
			Born in China, I graduated from the École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts in Paris. I have always been interested in the boundary of abstraction and figurative art, of art and life, and the fragility of my surroundings. Even a slab of paving-stone will be scratched, or worn, or part mud-splattered, and these traces of interaction are impermanent and changing. I have tried to highlight this uncertain state by using water-colours, which require as technique a process of repeated laying down of layers of colour, each layer not effacing but building up the previous.

I have taken these things from their wider context, flattened the perspective, and chosen a decomposition based upon their geometric structurality, rather than their standard decomposition into semantic blocks. Those usual labels carry with them some notion of eternal essence, I want to focus on them as they are, have been and might become.

More recently, I have wished to explore those parts which are obscured, invisible, those parts left to the imagination, with unlimited possibilities. It is in these unreal spaces that real-life takes place.
